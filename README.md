Get It Done! is a skeuomorphic to-do list web application with a moveable, built-in calculator. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript, plus dynamic templating via EJS, server functionality via Node.js, as well as a database via MongoDB and Mongoose, with a focus on keeping the user interface clean and simple, so as to stay out of the way of the user and let them focus on... getting it done!

This is my first web application! Through building this application, I really began to get a sense for how exciting it would be to work on a real web application used by people in their personal and professional pursuits.
